# Declining Sales of FashionHub
## Project Overview
A retail chain, FashionHub, is experiencing a decline in online sales. The marketing team suspects that their marketing strategies may not be reaching their target audience effectively, especially on weekends. The goal is to determine whether there's a statistically significant difference in sales between weekdays and weekends. If the weekend sales are indeed lower, FashionHub could then implement targeted strategies to boost weekend performance.
